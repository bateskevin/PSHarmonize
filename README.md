# PSHarmonize
Powershell Music framework

This is a very fresh project! There is literally no documentation available for now (which will change in the near future). 
THis readme file is basically just kind of a demo of what it can do and a Roadmap of what I plan it to be capable of.

## Create Music without musical knowledge

PSHarmonize let's you create Music without you having to know Musictheory or how to play an instrument.

How can it do that, you ask? It knows Music theory *for* you!
